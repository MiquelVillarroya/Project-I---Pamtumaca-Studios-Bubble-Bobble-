Our Project is a tribute of the arcade game Bubble Bobble, released in 1986 by TAITO. Bubble Bobble is a platform game in where the two main characters, Bub and Bob, have to surpass all the levels killing the enemies with their bubbles in order to rescue their girlfriends. 

Pamtumaca Studios is conformed by Miquel Villarroya and Noa Pont. Here's our logo and team photo:

We have both worked very hard in order to release this short version of the arcade game Bubble Bobble. During this project, Miquel delved into the hard work behind player and enemy physics, collisions, and enemy artificial intelligence, among many other things. Meanwhile, Noa focused more on level design, UI and animations, and music and sound effects.
